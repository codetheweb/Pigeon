- All around awesomeness!

## Q&A
#### Why PHP?
Really, the only other major option is NodeJS.  And while that's hip and cool, in my expereince it
- Is time consuming and hard to install on embeded ARM platforms
- Uses more resorces than Apache + PHP
Plus, PHP makes it ridiculusly easy to execute system commands.
